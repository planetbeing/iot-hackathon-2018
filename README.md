[here](https://www.tricider.com/admin/3E2sZgVMiRJ/4q8ooN5iJ6F).

## Hardware + What to Install

Our primary hardware is from Adafruit ([hardware list](https://www.adafruit.com/wishlists/457925)). We also have Arduino 101 kits provided
by Intel.

You will need to install the Arduino IDE to program the device. Depending on your operating system, you may require drivers for the
Feather HUZZAH. Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide) to install 
drivers and run the Blink Test and the Connecting via WiFi to make sure your system and WiFi are set up correctly.

Adafruit has several setup tutorials, videos, and articles available to help you familiarize yourself with the platform.
